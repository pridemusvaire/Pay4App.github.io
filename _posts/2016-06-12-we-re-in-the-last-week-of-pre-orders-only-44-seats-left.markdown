Howdy,

The response to Gava has been humbling, it's what we expected given the pressure and anticipation around the project.

Just thought I'd put out a quick update that we're in the last week of pre-orders, and that we have only about 44 seats remaining. After that we're closing off any orders and making the product available only to the pre-order group  until the September public launch. More on why that is in a blog post in the works.
